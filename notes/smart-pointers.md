> Advanced memory management with smart pointer types

## ðŸ“¦ Overview

*This section will cover:*
- `Box<T>` for heap allocation
- `Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>` for reference counting
- `RefCell<T>` and `Mutex<T>` for interior mutability
- `Weak<T>` for breaking reference cycles
- Custom smart pointer implementation
- Memory leak prevention

## ðŸ“‹ Learning Plan

### Prerequisites
- âœ… Complete [[lifetimes]] - Understanding reference management
- âœ… Complete [[traits]] - `Deref` and `Drop` traits
- âœ… Complete [[ownership]] - Move semantics and borrowing
- âœ… Understanding of heap vs stack allocation

### Topics to Cover
1. **Box<T> - Heap Allocation**
   - When to use `Box<T>`
   - Recursive data structures
   - Trait objects with `Box<dyn Trait>`

2. **Reference Counting**
   - `Rc<T>` for single-threaded shared ownership
   - `Arc<T>` for multi-threaded shared ownership
   - `Weak<T>` for breaking cycles

3. **Interior Mutability**
   - `RefCell<T>` for single-threaded mutation
   - `Mutex<T>` and `RwLock<T>` for thread-safe mutation
   - Borrowing rules at runtime vs compile-time

4. **Advanced Patterns**
   - Combining smart pointers (`Rc<RefCell<T>>`)
   - Custom smart pointer implementation
   - Memory leak detection and prevention

> Safe concurrent programming with threads, async/await, and message passing

## ðŸ”€ Overview

*This section will cover:*
- Thread creation and management
- Message passing with channels
- Shared state concurrency with `Arc<Mutex<T>>`
- Async/await programming model
- Parallel iterators with Rayon
- Deadlock prevention and performance considerations

## ðŸ“‹ Learning Plan

### Prerequisites
- âœ… Complete [[smart-pointers]] - `Arc<T>` and `Mutex<T>`
- âœ… Complete [[packaging]] - Managing dependencies
- âœ… Complete [[errors]] - Error handling in concurrent code
- âœ… Understanding of [[traits]] - `Send` and `Sync` traits

### Topics to Cover
1. **Threading Fundamentals**
   - `std::thread::spawn`
   - Thread joining and detaching
   - Thread-local storage

2. **Message Passing**
   - Channels: `mpsc::channel()`
   - Multiple producers, single consumer
   - Bounded vs unbounded channels

3. **Shared State**
   - `Arc<Mutex<T>>` patterns
   - `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for read-heavy workloads
   - Avoiding data races and deadlocks

4. **Async Programming**
   - `async`/`await` syntax
   - Futures and tasks
   - Async runtimes (Tokio, async-std)
   - Async channels and synchronization

5. **Parallelism**
   - Rayon for data parallelism
   - Parallel iterators
   - Work-stealing schedulers

> System-level programming with unsafe code and foreign function interfaces

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Overview

*This section will cover:*
- Understanding when unsafe is necessary
- Raw pointer manipulation
- Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
- Calling C libraries from Rust
- Writing safe abstractions over unsafe code
- Memory safety guarantees and violations

## üìã Learning Plan

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Complete [[smart-pointers]] - Understanding pointer types
- ‚úÖ Complete [[lifetimes]] - Memory safety concepts
- ‚úÖ Complete [[packaging]] - Build scripts and linking
- ‚úÖ Strong understanding of systems programming concepts

### Topics to Cover
1. **Unsafe Fundamentals**
   - `unsafe` blocks and functions
   - The five unsafe superpowers
   - Raw pointers: `*const T` and `*mut T`
   - Memory layout and alignment

2. **Foreign Function Interface**
   - Calling C functions from Rust
   - Passing data between Rust and C
   - Memory management across language boundaries
   - ABI considerations

3. **Safe Abstractions**
   - Encapsulating unsafe code
   - Maintaining invariants
   - Testing unsafe code
   - Documentation and safety contracts

4. **Advanced Unsafe**
   - Implementing custom allocators
   - Atomic operations
   - Inline assembly
   - Platform-specific code

# Traits

Traits ~ Interfaces

## Implementing Trait on a Type

``` rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}

pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}
```

Note that the implemented method type signature can be changed when it
comes to borrowing semantics, and making self mutable or not.

## Calling Trait Methods

Users of the crate can call the trait methods on instances of NewsArticle 
and Tweet in the same way we call regular methods. 

The only difference is that the user must bring the trait into scope 
as well as the types.

``` rust
use aggregator::{Summary, Tweet};

fn main() {
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
}
```

## Default Trait Implmentations

Types can override default implementations, which are good to have
if we just want a type to have a trait without implementing its 
methods, and don't have to modify any types that implement the trait.

``` rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        String::from("(Read more...)")
    }
}
```

Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even 
if those other methods donâ€™t have a default implementation. 

In this way, a trait can provide a lot of useful functionality and 
only require implementors to specify a small part of it.

``` rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
    }
}
```

Implementors would only be required to implement summarize_author:

``` rust
impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
        format!("@{}", self.username)
    }
}
```

Note that a trait can't have _non-overridable_ methods.

## Traits as Parameters

Accept any types that implement a trait:
``` rust
pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

this is syntantic sugar for _Trait Bounds_ which look like:
``` rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

## Generic Bound Syntax
The impl Trait syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in
simple cases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more 
complexity in other cases, for ex:
``` rust
// Using impl Trait is appropriate if we want this function to allow 
// item1 and item2 to have different types (as long as both types 
// implement Summary).
pub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) {

// If we want to force both parameters to have the same type, however,
// we must use a trait bound, like this:
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {
```

So basically one allows for different type implementors while the 
other allows for only a single type implementor.

## Multiple Trait Bounds with `+`
We can also specify more than one trait bound:

``` rust
pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {
```

The + syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:

``` rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {
```
With the two trait bounds specified, the body of notify can call summarize and use {} to format item.

Rust has alternate syntax for specifying trait bounds inside a where clause after the function signature. So, instead of writing this:

``` rust
fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {
```

we can use a where clause, like this:

``` rust
fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{
```

## Returning Types That Implement Traits
We can also use the impl Trait syntax in the return position to return a value of some type that implements a trait, as shown here:

``` rust
fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
    Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    }
```

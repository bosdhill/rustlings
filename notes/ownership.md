## Mutable vs Immutable References

Multiple immutable references are allowed because no one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else's reading of the data.

A reference's scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used:

```rust
// Multiple immutable references - allowed
let s = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &s;    // immutable reference 1
let r2 = &s;    // immutable reference 2
println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);  // both references are valid here
```

Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a **mutable reference** to a value, you can have **no other references** to that value.

```rust
// Mutable reference exclusivity
let mut s = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &mut s;    // mutable reference
// let r2 = &mut s; // ERROR: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once
// let r3 = &s;     // ERROR: cannot borrow `s` as immutable while it's borrowed as mutable
r1.push_str(", world");
println!("{}", r1);  // OK
```

## Ownership Rules

1. Each value in Rust has an **owner**.
2. There can only be one **owner** at a time.
3. When the **owner** goes out of scope, the value will be **dropped**.

> ðŸ’¡ These rules enable [[lifetimes]] and make smart pointers necessary for shared ownership

This is for *heap-allocated values*. For *stack-based values* for primitive types, they can be copied and
ownership semantics do not apply.

See [the stack and the heap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-stack-and-the-heap).

```rust
// Ownership example
{
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s owns the String
    // do stuff with s
}  // s goes out of scope, String is dropped

// Ownership transfer (move)
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;  // s1's ownership moves to s2
// println!("{}", s1);  // ERROR: s1 is no longer valid
```

## Borrowing vs Ownership

Borrowing will take a reference to a variable and do something with it, but cannot drop it.

Ownership is a mutable reference to some variable that can drop it.

**Borrowing** = an immutable or mutable reference to some variable, that is temporary to do some operation, but will *return ownership*

```rust
// Borrowing example
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {  // borrows s immutably
    s.len()
}  // s goes out of scope, but doesn't drop the String because it doesn't have ownership

let s1 = String::from("hello");
let len = calculate_length(&s1);  // passing a reference (&s1) is borrowing
println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);  // s1 is still valid here
```

**Ownership** = a mutable reference to some variable, that after going out of scope will *drop the value*

```rust
// Ownership transfer example
fn take_ownership(s: String) {  // s comes into scope
    println!("{}", s);
}  // s goes out of scope and `drop` is called, freeing memory

let s1 = String::from("hello");
take_ownership(s1);  // s1's value moves into the function
// println!("{}", s1);  // ERROR: s1 is no longer valid
```

# Structs

## Ownership of Struct Data

It's possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of [[lifetimes]].

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: &str,
    email: &str,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

## Update Syntax

Struct update syntax is a concise way to copy fields from one struct instance to another:

```rust
fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        active: user1.active,
        username: user1.username,
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
}
```

vs

```rust
fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
}
```

## Methods

### Ownership

The same rules apply to struct methods. Usually, you would only want to borrow (i.e. **immutable reference** to `self`), and not take ownership (i.e **mutable reference** to `self`):

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn width(&self) -> bool {
        self.width > 0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    if rect1.width() {
        println!("The rectangle has a nonzero width; it is {}", rect1.width);
    }
}
```

_Note: we donâ€™t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the data in the struct, not write to it. If we wanted to change the instance that weâ€™ve called the method on as part of what the method does, weâ€™d use `&mut self` as the first parameter. Having a method that takes ownership of the instance by using just `self` as the first parameter is rare; this technique is usually used when the method transforms self into something else and you want to prevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation._

### Automatic Dereferencing

Rust has a feature called _automatic referencing and dereferencing_. Calling methods is one of the few places in Rust with this behavior.

Hereâ€™s how it works: when you call a method with `object.something()`, Rust automatically adds in `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so the **object matches the signature of the method**. In other words, the following are the same:

```rust
p1.distance(&p2); // cleaner
(&p1).distance(&p2); // messy
```

This automatic referencing behavior works because methods have a **clear receiver**â€”the type of `self`. Given the receiver and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is reading (`&self`), mutating (`&mut self`), or consuming (`self`).

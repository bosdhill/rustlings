## 🔍 Knowledge Gaps

### Identified Weak Areas
- [ ] Complex lifetime scenarios
- [ ] Advanced trait usage
- [ ] Concurrent programming patterns

### Review Priorities
1. [[lifetimes]] - Need more practice with complex scenarios
2. [[traits]] - Advanced trait bounds and objects
3. [[errors]] - Custom error types and propagation

## 📈 Skill Assessment

Rate your confidence (1-5) in each area:

| Topic | Confidence | Last Reviewed | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| [[ownership]] | 4/5 | {{date}} | Solid foundation |
| [[enums]] | 4/5 | {{date}} | Good with pattern matching |
| [[option]] | 4/5 | {{date}} | Comfortable with all methods |
| [[errors]] | 3/5 | {{date}} | Need practice with `?` operator |
| [[generics]] | 3/5 | {{date}} | Basic usage ok, bounds confusing |
| [[traits]] | 3/5 | {{date}} | Implementation ok, advanced usage unclear |
| [[lifetimes]] | 2/5 | {{date}} | Basic annotations ok, complex scenarios difficult |
| [[collections]] | 4/5 | {{date}} | Vectors and HashMaps solid |

## 🎲 Random Review Generator
